Say you need to retrieve the first names F_NAME and last names L_NAME of all
employees who live in Elgin, IL. You can use the LIKE operator to retrieve 
strings that contain the said text. The code will look as shown below.

SELECT F_NAME, L_NAME 
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE ADDRESS LIKE '%Elgin,IL%';

Now assume that you want to identify the employees who were born during the 70s.
The query above can be modified to:

SELECT F_NAME, L_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE B_DATE LIKE '197%';

Note that in the first example, % sign is used both before and after the required text. This is to indicate, that the address string can have more characters, both before and after, the required text.

In the second example, since the date of birth in Eployees records starts with the birth year, the % sign is applied after 197%, indicating that the birth year can be anything between 1970 to 1979. Further the % sign also allows any possible date throughout the selected years.

Consider a more specific example. Let us retrieve all employee records in department 5 where salary is between 60000 and 70000. The query that will be used is

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE (SALARY BETWEEN 60000 AND 70000) AND DEP_ID = 5;


SORTING
--------

You can sort the retrieved entries on the basis of one or more parameters.

First, assume that you have to retrieve a list of employees ordered by department ID.

Sorting is done using the ORDER BY clause in your SQL query. By default, the ORDER BY clause sorts the records in ascending order.

SELECT * 
FROM EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY DEP_ID;

Now, get the output of the same query in descending order of department ID, and within each deaprtment, the records should be ordered in descending alphabetical order by last name. For descending order, you can make use of the DESC clause.

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY DEP_ID DESC, L_NAME DESC;

GROUPING
------------
In this exercise, you will go through some SQL problems on Grouping.

NOTE: The SQL problems in this exercise involve usage of SQL Aggregate functions AVG and COUNT. COUNT has been covered earlier. AVG is a function that can be used to calculate the Average or Mean of all values of a specified column in the result set. For example, to retrieve the average salary for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, issue the query: SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES;.

A good example of grouping would be if For each department ID, we wish to retrieve the number of employees in the department.

SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*)
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID;

Now, for each department, retrieve the number of employees in the department and the average employee salary in the department. For this, you can use COUNT(*) to retrieve the total count of a column, and AVG() function to compute average salaries, and then GROUP BY.

SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*), AVG(SALARY)
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID;

You can refine your outut by using appropriate labels for the columns of data retrieved. Label the computed columns in the result set of the last problem as NUM_EMPLOYEES and AVG_SALARY.

SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID;

You can also combine the usage of GROUP BY and ORDER BY statements to sort the output of each group in accordance with a specific parameter. It is important to note that in such a case, ORDER BY clause muct be used after the GROUP BY clause. For example, we can sort the result of the previous query by average salary. The SQL query would thus become

SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID
ORDER BY AVG_SALARY;

In case you need to filter a grouped response, you have to use the HAVING clause. In the previous example, if we wish to limit the result to departments with fewer than 4 employees, We will have to use HAVING after the GROUP BY, and use the count() function in the HAVING clause instead of the column label.

SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID
HAVING COUNT(*) < 4
ORDER BY AVG_SALARY;

PRACTICE QUESTIONS
=====================================
Retrieve the list of all employees, first and last names, whose first names start with ‘S’.

SELECT F_NAME, L_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE F_NAME LIKE 'S%';

Arrange all the records of the EMPLOYEES table in ascending order of the date of birth.

SELECT F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE
FROM EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY B_DATE;

Group the records in terms of the department IDs and filter them of ones that have average salary more than or equal to 60000. Display the department ID and the average salary.

SELECT DEP_ID, AVG(SALARY)
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID
HAVING AVG(SALARY) >= 60000;

For the problem above, sort the results for each group in descending order of average salary.

SELECT DEP_ID, AVG(SALARY)
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEP_ID
HAVING AVG(SALARY) >= 60000
ORDER BY AVG(SALARY) DESC;
