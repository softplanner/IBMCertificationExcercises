<!-- JOINS
Let us see some examples of JOINS being used to query the data.

1. Retrieve the names and job start dates of all employees who work for department number 5.
We need to use the Inner join operation with the EMPLOYEES table as the left table and the JOB_HISTORY table as the right table. The join will be made over employee ID, and the query response will be filtered for the Department ID value 5.
The query for this question will be as shown below. -->

SELECT E.F_NAME,E.L_NAME, JH.START_DATE 
FROM EMPLOYEES as E 
INNER JOIN JOB_HISTORY as JH 
ON E.EMP_ID=JH.EMPL_ID 
WHERE E.DEP_ID ='5';

<!-- 2. Retrieve employee ID, last name, department ID, and department name for all employees.
For this, you must use the Left Outer Join operation with the EMPLOYEES table as the left table and the DEPARTMENTS table as the right table. The join will happen on the Department ID.

Left join query retrieves all employees, including their department details if available. If an employee does not belong to any department, the department fields will be NULL.

The query will be written as follows: -->

SELECT E.EMP_ID, E.L_NAME, E.DEP_ID, D.DEP_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES AS E 
LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D 
ON E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP;

<!-- 3. Retrieve the First name, Last name, and Department name of all employees.
For this, you will use the Full Outer Join operation with the EMPLOYEES table as the left table and the DEPARTMENTS table as the right table. A full outer join in MySQL is implemented as a UNION of left and right outer joins.

Full Outer Join query retrieves all employees and departments, showing all combinations. If an employee is not associated with a department, or a department has no employees, the missing fields will be NULL.

The query will be written as shown below. -->

SELECT E.F_NAME, E.L_NAME, D.DEP_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES AS E
LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D
ON E.DEP_ID = D.DEPT_ID_DEP

UNION

SELECT E.F_NAME, E.L_NAME, D.DEP_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES AS E
RIGHT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D
ON E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP;

<!-- OR BUT MY SQL DID NOT SUPPORT FULL OUTER JOIN-->

SELECT E.F_NAME, E.L_NAME, D.DEP_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES AS E
FULL OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D
ON E.DEP_ID = D.DEPT_ID_DEP;

<!-- Practice Problems -->

<!-- 1. Retrieve the names, job start dates, and job titles of all employees who work for department number 5. 
Hint
Perform an INNER JOIN with 3 tables: EMPLOYEES, JOB_HISTORY, JOBS.-->

select E.F_NAME,E.L_NAME, JH.START_DATE, J.JOB_TITLE 
from EMPLOYEES as E 
INNER JOIN JOB_HISTORY as JH on E.EMP_ID=JH.EMPL_ID 
INNER JOIN JOBS as J on E.JOB_ID=J.JOB_IDENT
where E.DEP_ID ='5';

<!-- 2. Retrieve employee ID, last name, and department ID for all employees but department names for only those born before 1980.

Hint
Use an AND in the LEFT OUTER JOIN clause. -->

SELECT E.EMP_ID, E.L_NAME, E.DEP_ID, D.DEP_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES AS E
LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D
ON E.DEP_ID = D.DEPT_ID_DEP
AND YEAR(E.B_DATE) < 1980;

<!-- 3. Retrieve the first name and last name of all employees but department ID and department names only for male employees.

Hint
Add an AND in Query 3A to filter on male employees in the ON clause. Alternatively, you can also use Left Outer Join. -->

SELECT E.F_NAME, E.L_NAME, D.DEPT_ID_DEP, D.DEP_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES AS E
LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D
ON E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP AND E.SEX = 'M'

UNION

SELECT E.F_NAME, E.L_NAME, D.DEPT_ID_DEP, D.DEP_NAME
from EMPLOYEES AS E
RIGHT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS AS D
ON E.DEP_ID=D.DEPT_ID_DEP AND E.SEX = 'M';
